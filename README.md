McDonald's Market Segmentation Analysis

This project replicates a case study from the book Market Segmentation Analysis (Page 269), using Python.

ðŸ§  Objective

To identify hidden customer segments based on their perception of McDonald's and understand what drives customer liking in each segment.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset includes:

11 perception variables (e.g., Taste, Cleanliness, Value for Money)

1 target variable: Like (ordinal scale from "I hate it!-5" to "I love it!+5")

ðŸ§ª Methodology

Converted ordinal responses to numeric scale

Converted categorical Yes/No responses to binary

Applied a Gaussian Mixture Model to segment customers into 2 groups

Fitted a linear regression model to each segment to understand which perceptions influence liking in that group

ðŸ’» Technologies Used

Python

pandas

NumPy

scikit-learn

statsmodels

Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“ˆ Key Learnings

Different customer groups value different features of a brand

Segmentation helps in personalizing marketing strategies

Model-based segmentation offers deeper insight than basic clustering
